# Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression
This repository contains a project focused on building a predictive model using linear regression to predict numerical outcomes based on one or more features. The project utilizes a dataset with a continuous target variable to demonstrate the principles and application of linear regression in predictive modeling.

## Project Overview
Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). This project aims to build and evaluate a linear regression model to predict a continuous target variable from a given dataset.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset, visualizing relationships, and identifying patterns.
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering.
- Model Building: Implementing simple and multiple linear regression models.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²).
- Visualization: Plotting regression lines, residuals, and other relevant graphs to interpret the model.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the salary dataset from Kaggle.

## Methodology
- Data Collection: Imported the dataset and performing initial inspections.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize data distributions and relationships between variables. Identifying potential correlations and outliers.
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values. Normalizing or scaling features. Creating new features if necessary.
- Model Building: Implementing simple linear regression for single feature prediction. Extending to multiple linear regression for multi-feature prediction.
- Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R² to evaluate model accuracy. Cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
- Visualization: Plotting regression lines, residual plots, and other diagnostics.

## Results
The project demonstrates how linear regression can be applied to predict numerical outcomes. Key insights include:
- Understanding the relationship between features and the target variable.
- Interpreting model coefficients to assess feature importance.
- Evaluating model performance and diagnosing potential issues through visualization.
